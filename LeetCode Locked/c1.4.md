## Shortest Word Distance I, II, III


>**Question 1**

Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,
Assume that `words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

Given `word1 = "coding"`, `word2 = "practice"`, return 3.
Given `word1 = "makes"`, `word2 = "coding"`, return 1.

>**Note**

You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

>**Solution**

The naive idea is very easy. But could you solve it in one-pass? Well, the one-pass code (taken from [here](https://leetcode.com/discuss/50234/ac-java-clean-solution)) is rewritten in C++ as follows.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
        int n = words.size(), idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1, dist = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (words[i] == word1) {
                idx1 = i;
                if (idx1 != -1 && idx2 != -1)
                    dist = min(dist, abs(idx1 - idx2)); //Update min condition only if there is a match
            }
            else if (words[i] == word2) {
                idx2 = i;
                if (idx1 != -1 && idx2 != -1)
                    dist = min(dist, abs(idx1 - idx2)); //Update min condition only if there is a match
            }
            
        }
        return dist;
    }
};
```

>**Question 2**

Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,

Assume that `words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

Given `word1 = "coding”`, `word2 = "practice”`, return 3.
Given `word1 = "makes"`, `word2 = "coding"`, return 1.

>**Note**

You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

>**Solution**

This is a follow up of Shortest Word Distance. The only difference is now you are given the list of words and your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. How would you optimize it?

The key idea is to store the indexes of each word using a hash map. Then the function shortest() is just to find the minimum difference between two sorted lists (see [here](https://leetcode.com/discuss/50185/java-solution-using-minimum-difference-between-sorted-arrays) for a method).

```c++
class WordDistance {
public:
    WordDistance(vector<string> words) {
        int n = words.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            wordInd[words[i]].push_back(i);
    }

    int shortest(string word1, string word2) {
        vector<int> indexes1 = wordInd[word1];
        vector<int> indexes2 = wordInd[word2];
        int m = indexes1.size(), n = indexes2.size();
        int i = 0, j = 0, dist = INT_MAX;
        while (i < m && j < n) {
            dist = min(dist, abs(indexes1[i] - indexes2[j]));
            if (indexes1[i] < indexes2[j]) i++;
            else j++;
        }
        return dist;
    }
private:
    unordered_map<string, vector<int> > wordInd;
};


// Your WordDistance object will be instantiated and called as such:
// WordDistance wordDistance(words);
// wordDistance.shortest("word1", "word2");
// wordDistance.shortest("anotherWord1", "anotherWord2");
```

>**Question 3**

Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

word1 and word2 may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.

For example,

Assume that `words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

Given `word1 = "makes"`, `word2 = "coding"`, return 1. Given `word1 = "makes"`, `word2 = "makes"`, return 3.

Note:

You may assume word1 and word2 are both in the list.

```c++
//C++: 20ms
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestWordDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
        int n = words.size();
        int p1 = -1, p2 = -1, dist = INT_MAX;
        for(int i=0; i<n; ++i){
            if(word1==word2){
                if(words[i]==word1){
                    if(p1>p2) p2 = i;
                    else p1 = i;
                }
            }else{
                if(words[i]==word1) p1 = i;
                if(words[i]==word2) p2 = i;
            }
            if(p1>=0 && p2>=0)
                dist = min(dist, abs(p1-p2));
        }
        return dist;
    }
};
```
