##Reverse Words in a String II

>**Question** 

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words are always separated by a single space.

For example,
Given s = "the sky is blue",
return "blue is sky the".
Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?

>**Idea** Reverse twice, both in place.


>**Time** O(n) Space: O(1)
